# Key Calibration Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Value Ranges | Known Good Values | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Z offset | Affects distance of nozzle to bed | [-3.5mm, -4.0mm] | [-3.75mm, -3.95mm] | Changing nozzle reset this. Nozzle size, line width and flow rate will affect the optimal value |
